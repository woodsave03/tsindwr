# You have much potential, Adventurer
###### Potential Scores

Each creature is made up of a set of 8 scores called **Potentials**. Each of these Potentials represent a character's capacity to success relating to a given category. Potentials are split between Physical and Mental: Physical Potentials relate to a creature's bodily and physical capabilities, whereas Mental Potentials relate to a creature's intellectual and mental capabilities. The 8 different Potentials are as follows:

# The meat and potatoes of gameplay
###### Skills

When a player takes an action that requires a certain amount of skill or luck, it often requires a Skill Test. A **Skill Test** is a [[Resolution System|Test]] associated with a particular Skill. Each Potential Score has three subcategories called Skills. Skill Tests are unique due to their potential for a creature to be proficient in the roll. 

Proficiency in Skills can be achieved with class features, background features, and racial features. When proficient in a skill, a creature rolls 1 additional Volatility Die when testing that specific Skill.

> [!warning]- The Rule of Narrative Ease
> During gameplay, there are many situations where taking action may not require a test of a character's ability, and can be resolved purely narratively. Be sure not to bog down the narrative flow with excessive Skill Tests, and allow players to tell the story they want to build.
