# Stress and Fallout
## Success Comes at a Price
###### Stress

**Stress** affects not only the results of Volatility Dice, but also a creature's defensive capabilities. As the representation of the strain a creature has accumulated during gameplay, Stress builds up in each of your Potential tracks and overflows if it exceeds the maximum value, so the more Potential a player has, the more defense they have against the setbacks of Stress. 

The more Stress a player accumulates, the more likely they are to fall to this strain. Stress can come from enemies' attacks, or the call can come from inside the house:

1. Rolling without Volatility on a Test that results in a success level of 3 or more (Mixed+) results in accumulating a point of Stress in the relevant Potential track.
2. When rolling with Volatility results in a value within its **jinx threshold**[^1] and the overall Test results in a success level of 3 or more (Mixed+), then the player gains a point of Stress in the relevant Potential track.

###### Fallout

**Fallout** is an accumulation of misfortune and heroic strain, providing an extra risk to initiating Tests. Fallout can be triggered in a few ways, all determined by the rolling of Tests:

1. Rolling without Volatility on a Test that results in a success level of 3 or lower (Mixed-) results in triggering Fallout.
2. When rolling with Volatility results in a value within its **jinx threshold**[^1] and the overall Test results in a success level of 4 or less (success level with cost or Success*-), then Fallout is triggered.

Once Fallout is triggered, that Potential's Stress track is reset to 0.
###### Types of Fallout

Depending on the amount of Stress accumulated in a Potential track, different intensities of Fallout can occur:

1. Minor Fallout - result of 1-2 Stress applied
2. Major Fallout - result of 3-5 Stress applied
3. Severe Fallout - result 6+ Stress applied

Minor Fallout is often a result of a Test resulting in a success level with a cost, only causing a Minor Condition or 1 Mark. Major Fallout can be a result of a Miff, and causes either a 3 Marks, Minor Condition with 1 Mark, or a Major Condition. Severe Fallout is the only Fallout intensity that can only be caused by class features, and often causes a Major Condition with 3 Marks or a number of Marks equal to the number of Stress points applied.
