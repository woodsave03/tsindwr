<h2 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h2>

<div class="sunder-guide-card">

We rely on feedback from the community to improve Sunder TTRPG. Here's how to report different types of issues:

### Using the Highlight Popup

1. Select the problematic text
2. Click the <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> (Report Issue) button
3. Fill out the form with details about what seems wrong
4. Submit your report

### Using the Report Form Directly

You can also visit the [Report an Issue](../report-issue/) page directly to submit feedback without highlighting text first.

### What to Include

When reporting an issue, try to include:

- **The specific location** (page and section)
- **What seems wrong** (typo, unclear wording, broken link, etc.)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact** (optional, if you'd like a response)
